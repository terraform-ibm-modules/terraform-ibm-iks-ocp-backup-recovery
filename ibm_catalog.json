It automates the deployment of the Data Source Connector (DSC), cluster registration, security group rules, and protection policies to protect namespaces, persistent volumes, and cluster resources.\n\nTwo variations are available: a fully configurable option for production-grade deployments with fine-grained control, and a QuickStart option for rapid setup with sensible defaults. Both leverage reusable Terraform IBM Modules for consistency and best practices.\n\nYou can extend this architecture using other [Terraform IBM Modules](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules) to incorporate additional observability, security, or compliance features as needed.",
