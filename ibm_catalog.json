      "long_description": "The Cloud Automation for Backup and Recovery on IBM Kubernetes Service (IKS) or Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud (ROKS) simplifies the configuration of cluster protection using IBM Backup & Recovery Service. It deploys the Data Source Connector (DSC) via Helm, registers the cluster, adds necessary security group rules, and creates a configurable protection policy with scheduled backups and retention.\n\nLeverage [Terraform IBM Modules](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules) to shape and scale your solutions. You can integrate Terraform IBM Modules (TIM) to extend functionality and design a solution tailored to your environment and operations needs. These modules offer reusable, customizable elements that follow IBM Cloud's recommended practices. You can access the [source code and documentation](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-iks-ocp-backup-recovery) and use it to extend your current architecture or create new solutions.\n\nℹ️ This Terraform-based automation is part of a broader suite of IBM-maintained Infrastructure as Code (IaC) assets, each following the naming pattern \"Cloud automation for *servicename*\" and focusing on single IBM Cloud service. These single-service deployable architectures can be used on their own to streamline and automate service deployments through an [IaC approach](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-understanding-projects), or assembled together into a broader [automated IaC stack](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-config-stack) to automate the deployment of an end-to-end solution architecture.",
